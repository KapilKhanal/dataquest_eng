Have you ever taken an online course and wondered why it didn't all stick?

Here's how to get DataQuest's Data Engineering Track missions' content to work on your localhost.
Using data from my <a href = "https://github.com/nmolivo/valencia-data-projects/tree/master/valenbisi">Valenbisi ARIMA modeling project</a>, I will walk through steps using PostgreSQL, Postico, and the Command Line to get our DataQuest exercises running out of a Jupyter Notebook. 

This will not be a repeat of the many resources I used, so be sure to look out for any links I include if it seems I've skipped a few steps.

### Getting started with PostgreSQL and Postico:
PostgreSQL <a href = "https://www.postgresql.org/download/">download</a>
Postico <a href = "https://eggerapps.at/postico/">download</a>

<b>1. Configure Postgres</b><br>
I found <a href = "https://www.codementor.io/engineerapart/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-osx-are8jcopb">this source</a> incredibly helpful.
It walked me through installation, creating users, and connecting to a local database.
To access the CLI: click the database created, "valenbisi2018", for this example.
